eg. 
0, 3   
1 ,4
2, 5

We will choose the video which is suitable to shoot at current place and also able to maxdrift.

initial curr val = 0 , and maxreached = 0;
We select from all available videos which is lesser than our curr_val and whose end point is as far as possible now we will replace our curr to that position.

int mn = 0 , mx = 0, tot = 0;
while(mx < time){
    for(int i = 0 ; i < clips.size(); i++){
        int l = clips[i][0];
        int r = clips[i][1];
        
        // We will select the one who cover our mn value and whose right most is maximum and update that. 
        if(l <= mn && r > mx){
            mx = r;
        }

    }
    if(mn == mx) return -1;
    tot++;
    mn = mx;
}
return tot;

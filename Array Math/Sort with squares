Given a sorted array A containing N integers both positive and negative.
You need to create another array containing the squares of all the elements in A and return it in non-decreasing order.
Try to this in O(N) time.


When we have to do some task in O(n) try to think of hashmap.

int n = A.size();
vector<int> ans(1001);
for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
    ans[abs(A[i])]++;
}
vector<int> res;
for(int i = 0 ; i < 1001 ; i++){
    while(ans[i] > 0){
        res.push_back(i*i);
        ans[i]--;
    }
}
return res;

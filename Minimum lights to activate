There is a corridor in a Jail which is N units long. Given an array A of size N. The ith index of this array is 0 if the light at ith position is faulty otherwise it is 1.
All the lights are of specific power B which if is placed at position X, it can light the corridor from [ X-B+1, X+B-1].
Initially all lights are off.
Return the minimum number of lights to be turned ON to light the whole corridor or -1 if the whole corridor cannot be lighted.

Here all position before this unlightened position are lightened Now greedily select 1 for light this position.
Here we will go to unlightened position and find the 1 that can light for searching we give priority from right to left.



Here after we have found that index, We can safely go to i + R since all these points will get light. 

int count = 0;
int R = B-1, n = A.size();
for(int i = 0 ; i< A.size(); i++){
    bool flag = false;
    for(int j = min(i + R, n-1) ; j >= max(0, i - R) ; j--){
        if(A[j] == 1){
            count++;
            i = j + R;
            flag = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if(!flag)   return -1;
}
return count;

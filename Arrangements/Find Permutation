Here, first count balance that is Number of i on right hand side. Means this much time we have to increase our value.
When I is seen increment that curr with this number i.e. position of this I. 

int d = 0, i =0 ;
for(char x: A){
    d += (x == 'D');
    i += (x == 'I');
}
int curr = B-i;
d = 0, i = 0;
vector<int> ans = {curr};
for(char x: A){
    if(x == 'D'){
        ans.push_back(curr + (--d));
    }
    else{
        ans.push_back(curr + (++i));
    }
}
return ans;

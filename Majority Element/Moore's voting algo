Here, find number whose occurance is more than floor(n/2).
Here, idea is we assume every candidate as majority and keep and count 
if curr is not same as majority decrease the count and if same then increase.
if count = 0 make current as majority.

int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int cnt = 0 , maj;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < n; i++){
        if(cnt == 0)
            maj = nums[i];
        cnt += (maj == nums[i])?1:-1;
    }
    return maj;
}

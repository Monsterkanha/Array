f(i, j) is defined as |A[i] - A[j]| + |i - j|, where |x| denotes absolute value of x.
We have to find maximum value.
Assume i am taking for i < j only that reverse will automatically covered.

if Ai < Aj then 
fij = Aj + j - (Ai +i) 
so we can replace every value as sum of its value and index.
if Ai > Aj then

fij = Ai - i + Aj - j
replace each value by difference of its value and index.

Just finding maximum in these two. and difference as maximum will be our answer.


int n = A.size();
vector<int> sub(n) , add(n);
int mxdiff = INT_MIN , mndiff = INT_MAX , mxadd = INT_MIN, mnadd = INT_MAX;
for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
    mxdiff = max(A[i]-i , mxdiff);
    mndiff = min(A[i]-i , mndiff);

    mxadd = max(A[i]+i , mxadd);
    mnadd = min(A[i]+i , mnadd);
}

return max(mxdiff - mndiff , mxadd - mnadd);

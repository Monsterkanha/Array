Elegant way to check whether two opposite are equal or not.

int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {
    /* A rectangle has 4 sides and if any 2 are equal,
    *  then other 2 must be equal as well.
    *  So pick any 2 among 4 is 4C2 = 6.
    *  Check 6 conditions and you done.
    Simple solution.

    if(A == B) return C == D;
    else if(A == C) return B == D;
    else if(A == D) return B == C;
    else return false;
    
}
